# A-Star-Unscrambler
Python Word Unscrambler using the A* Pathfinding Algorithm

Given a goal word and its scrambled letters, the program will unscramble it by swapping two adjacent characters, automatically finding the path with the fewest steps to reach the goal word.

To edit the word, change lines 95 and 96 with start and goal respectively.
